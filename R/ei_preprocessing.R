#' Internal function that checks for adequate closeness between sums
#' of race columns and provided vote totals.
#' 
#' This function checks conditions inputted to clean_race by the user
#' 
#' When this function returns 0, votes do not sum close enough 
#' to the provided vote totals. 
#' 
#' When this function returns 1, votes sum  marginally away 
#' from the provided totals. Restandardization is appropriate
#'  
#' When this function returns 2, votes sum exactly to vote
#' totals 
#' 
#' @param vote_sums A numeric vector containing the sums of votes by each race/ethnicity
#' @param provided_totals A numeric vector containing the totals provided to the clean_race function
#' @param max_dev A flaoting point object passed from clean_race
#' @param avg_dev A floating point object passed from clean_race
#' 
#' @return A numeric vector 0, 1, or 2.

#' Converts raw vote totals from different race/ethnicies across precincts 
#' into proportions, checking for problematic differences between known
#' vote totals and sums across race/ethnicities.
#' 
#' If race turnout columns sum row-wise to equal vote_totals, they are 
#' returned as proportions. 
#'  
#' If race turnout columns sum row-wise to sufficiently close to 
#' vote_totals, they are returned as proportions of the sums.
#'  
#' If race turnout columns sum row-wise exceedingly far from 
#' vote_totals, the function stops and returns an error message.
#'
#' @param data A dataframe of election results, where each row represents a precinct or geographic voting unit.
#' @param cols A character vector with the names of the columns indicating total votes cast by each race
#' @param totals_col A character string with the name of the total vote count column in the data. If null, total votes are computed within the function.
#' @param max_dev A floating point object indicating the maximum allowable deviation of a precinct's vote sum from the totals in totals_col
#' @param avg_dev A floating point object indicating the maximum average deviation of all precints' vote sums from the totals in totals_col
#' @param verbose A boolean indicating whether to print warnings and messages.
#'
#' @export
#' 
#' @return A dataframe with proportions corresponding to the turnout of each race/ethnicity group.
