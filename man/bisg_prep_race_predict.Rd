\usage{
bisg_prep_race_predict(
  df,
  voterid = NULL,
  precinct = NULL,
  surname_char,
  state,
  census.geo = "block",
  census.key,
  census.data,
  census.surname = TRUE,
  surname.only = FALSE,
  surname.year = 2010,
  age = FALSE,
  sex = FALSE,
  party,
  retry = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{data.frame() object, containing voter file information with FIPS
code information extracted using unit_comb_extract() function, which brings
in relevant columns}

\item{voterid}{String of voterid column name. Default = NULL. Probably want
this.}

\item{precinct}{String of precinct column name. Default = NULL. Probably
want this.}

\item{surname_char}{String of surname_char column name. This column is
passed to wru package.}

\item{state}{String of two digit state abbreviation, e.g., "NY", or "CA".}

\item{census.geo}{String of geographic level used for BISG. Default is
Census "block". An optional character vector specifying what level of
geography to use to merge in U.S. Census 2010 geographic data. Currently
"county", "tract", "block", and "place" are supported. Note: sufficient
information must be in user-defined voter.file object. If census.geo =
"county", then voter.file must have column named county. If census.geo =
"tract", then voter.file must have columns named county and tract. And if
census.geo = "block", then voter.file must have columns named county, tract,
and block. If census.geo = "place", then voter.file must have column named
place. Specifying census.geo will call census_helper function to merge
Census geographic data at specified level of geography.}

\item{census.key}{A character object specifying user's Census API key.
Required if census.geo is specified, because a valid Census API key is
required to download Census geographic data.}

\item{census.data}{A list indexed by two-letter state abbreviations, which
contains pre-saved Census geographic data. Can be generated using
get_census_data function from wru package.}

\item{census.surname}{A TRUE/FALSE object. If TRUE, function will call
merge_surnames to merge in Pr(Race | Surname) from U.S. Census Surname List
(2000 or 2010) and Spanish Surname List. If FALSE, voter.file object must
contain additional fields specifying Pr(Race | Surname), named as follows:
p_whi for Whites, p_bla for Blacks, p_his for Hispanics/Latinos, p_asi for
Asians, and/or p_oth for Other. Default is TRUE.}

\item{surname.only}{A TRUE/FALSE object. If TRUE, race predictions will only
use surname data and calculate Pr(Race | Surnname). Default is FALSE.}

\item{surname.year}{A number to specify the year of the census surname
statistics. These surname statistics is stored in the data, and will be
automatically loaded. The default value is 2010, which means the surname
statistics from the 2010 census will be used. Currently, the other available
choice is 2000.}

\item{age}{An optional TRUE/FALSE object specifying whether to condition
race predictions on age (in addition to surname and geolocation). Default is
FALSE. Must be same as age in census.data object. May only be set to TRUE if
census.geo option is specified. If TRUE, voter.file should include a
numerical variable age.}

\item{sex}{optional TRUE/FALSE object specifying whether to condition race
predictions on sex (in addition to surname and geolocation). Default is
FALSE. Must be same as sex in census.data object. May only be set to TRUE if
census.geo option is specified. If TRUE, voter.file should include a
numerical variable sex, where sex is coded as 0 for males and 1 for females.}

\item{party}{An optional character object specifying party registration
field in voter.file, e.g., party = "PartyReg". If specified, race/ethnicity
predictions will be conditioned on individual's party registration (in
addition to geolocation). Whatever the name of the party registration field
in voter.file, it should be coded as 1 for Democrat, 2 for Republican, and 0
for Other.}

\item{retry}{The number of retries at the census website if network
interruption occurs. Default = 0.}
}
\value{
List object of of two data.frames. List item 1 is initial voter file
data.frame. List object 2 (named bisg) includes race predictions.
