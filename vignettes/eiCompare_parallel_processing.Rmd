This vignette aims to highlight the parallel processing capabilities within eiCompare. Functions that include this option are
- `ei_iter()`

- `ei_rxc()` (only for diagnostic)

- [INSERT GEOCODING FUNCTION NAME HERE]

Prior to attempting to run these functions in parallel, it is advised you check your computer or server for the following properites:

- You should more than 4 physical cores

- You should have at least 16 GB of RAM


## Introduction to parallel processing

Building off of exisiting parallel processing packages such as `foreach` and `doSNOW`,  this package includes parallel processing capabiltiies to speed of ecological inference analyses.

_Parallel processing_ speeds up your processes by splitting the job amongst your computer's CPU cores. You need the requirements above to ensure you have enough RAM so that R can store the data you are currently working on. But, if you are using multiple cores, the RAM minimum RAM needed is the product of the number of cores you're using and the size of your data.  if you are working on say 4 cores and your data is 1GB, you'll be using at least 4 GB of RAM.

In order to make this more accessible to users, eiCompare's functions that include parallel processing include these checks. There are many sources online if you'd like to learn more about this method.

## Walking through an example: `ei_iter()`

In this vignette, we'll be focusing on `ei_iter()`, which is discussed in a previous vignette, [INSERT TITLE HERE]. We recommend that you review this vignette prior to attempting parallelization for this function. 

The data we'll be using for this example is from 2014 elections in California, specifically looking at voting results and racial demogrphiacs for Corona, CA by precinct.

```{r}
head(corona)
```

We have a row for every precinct, if we check the dimensions of our dataset you will see that this is 46. We also have 12 variables included in this dataset.
```{r}
print(dim(corona))
names(corona)
```

The variables are as follows:
  - `precinct`: Precinct ID number     
  
  - `totvote`: Total number of votes cast
  
  - `pct_husted`: Percent of voting precinct population who voted for Husted
  
  - `pct_spiegel`: Percent of voting precinct population who voted for Spiegel
  
  - `pct_ruth`: Percent of voting precinct population who voted for Ruth   
  
  - `pct_button`:  Percent of voting precinct population who voted for Button 
  
  - `pct_montanez`: Percent of voting precinct population who voted for Montanez
  
  - `pct_fox`: Percent of voting precinct population who voted for Fox     
  
  - `pct_hisp`: Percent of voting precinct population who identify as Hispanic 
  
  - `pct_asian`: Percent of voting precinct population who identify as Asian  
  
  - `pct_white`: Percent of voting precinct population who identify as White 
  
  - `pct_non_lat`: Percent of voting precinct population who identify as Non-Latino
  
  

Non-Latino encompasses the Asian and White voting population.
```{r}
corona$pct_hisp + corona$pct_non_lat == 1
```

So for this analysis there are 5 candidates (Husted, Spiegel, Ruth, Button, and Montanez) and there are 3 racial groups (Hispanic/Latino, Asian, and White). With that, let's set up the inputs we need for the function and time it to see how long it takes to complete the iterative ei analysis.

```{r}
cand_cols <- c("pct_husted", "pct_spiegel", "pct_ruth", "pct_button", "pct_montanez", "pct_fox")
race_cols <- c("pct_hisp", "pct_asian", "pct_white", "pct_non_lat")
totals_col <- "totvote"

# Run without parallization
start_time <- Sys.time()
results_test <- ei_iter(corona, cand_cols, race_cols, totals_col)
(end_time <- Sys.time() - start_time)
```

To run in this parallel, all you need to do is toggle `par_compute` to be TRUE.
```{r}
# Run with paralleization
start_time <- Sys.time()
results_test <- ei_iter(corona, cand_cols, race_cols, totals_col, par_compute = TRUE)
(end_time <- Sys.time() - start_time)
```
This saves us a about a minute for this specific data set. With larger datasets and more candidate and racial demographic comparisons, the process will take longer and parallelization will become more beneficial.

## Expectations for parallelization

Depending on things such as your dataset, the number of races and candidates you're analyzung, the amount of RAM you have, and the number of physical and logical cores you have the amount of time it takes to run eiCompare functions in parallel will differ. These functions will only stop the run if you don't meet the requirements of having 8 cores, including physical and logical. We recommend that you look into and have a complete understanding of the capabilities of the computer or server that you're running eiCompare on.

Furthermore, its important to uderstand parallelizing requires overhead time and relationships between sample size and run time are not necessarily linear. In the plot below, you'll be able to see the average run time of a dataset for a sample of 100, 200, and 300 precincts. Nonetheless, parallelization can save multitudes of the ~4 minutes saved here especially if you repeat function calls for any of the eiCompare functions that include a paralllel option.
